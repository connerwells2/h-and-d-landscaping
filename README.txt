My project is a simple landscaping website for my friends' business.

The features I decided to include was a form with 2 types of valiadtion (email and phone number - both shown in contactus.html), an example of .nth child (found in main page), and examples of using Flexbox to rearrange content to fit the screen as the width changes (found on main page). 

There are no special requirements.
